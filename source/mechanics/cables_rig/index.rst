Cable Management On Rig
=======================
As I do not like cable ties to be spread overall, I started to get a clean cable
management on the rig itself. For this reason I started to print cable channels,
which are attached to the dovetails. The advantage is if you need to remove a wire
you just could do it without any tools.

So I started removing all the cable ties from my rig. PartI.

I also did some clips to attach two cable to each other.
