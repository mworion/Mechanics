Cable Management To Mount
=========================
The connection to the mount consists of 3 wires power supply (one ground 2,5 mm
:sup:`2`, one 12V 1,5 mm :sup:`2` for PC, one 12V 1,5 mm :sup:`2` for UPB) and a
single line ethernet cat6 wire.,nothing else. So there is no USB connection
outside the OTA on top of the setup. I tried to use cable as short as possible.

For cable management I did some brackets and sliders with my 3D printer. for
the used parts you find the 3D STL files on

OTA to Mount
------------
OTA is "sandwiched" between two aluminium plates for better stiffness of the
OTA rings.

Cable running second arc to bracket on RA mounting. The screws fit in the place,
where the 10micron laser adapter will be fitted.

With this construction there is no force to any RA / DEC axis and both
rotations could be handled separately. For an overall flexibility over the
hemisphere there should be no issues.

Connection slider / bracket
---------------------------
Basic idea is that I could detach the cables when I tear down my setup. The
cable is linked to a slider, which connects to the bracket. Like other
connections in astronomy it's a type of dovetail solution.

Cables on OTA
-------------
On top of the dew shield of the OTA the FlipFlat and an Unihedron SQM is
attached.

On tho top base plate of the OTA there is a stack of the Pegasus Ultimate
Power Box and an embedded PC (really embedded -40 to +85 degrees C) running Ubuntu
18.04. As I have more than one temp sensor (MGBox, UPB, SQM) I used the temp
sensor of the UPB on top of the embedded PC to measure the housing temp of the
stack (important if the setup stays outside covered, but in the sun)
