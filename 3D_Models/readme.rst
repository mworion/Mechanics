Description of parts
--------------------

..note:: Please remind the following comments from Scott:

You will need two M6-32 x 16 mm screws to attach cable-holder-part1.stl to the mount, replacing the 
much too shallow screws that are removed from the mount housing.

The T-bracket (cable-plate.stl) that you attach to your scope dovetail doesn't work for my setup and 
is likely only useful to you (specific to your scope, dovetail, and riser blocks). Requires a lot of 
vertical space between dovetail and scope and a particular hole pattern in the plate

Cable holder parts 2 and 3 (cable-holder-part3.stl) are redundant. I prefer cable-holder-part2.stl 
because it fits better.

Probably no big deal for somebody printing their own parts, but I paid for two parts that I couldn't 
use from a commercial 3D print shop.
